I have already added the system call: getprocs(), which will loop the proc table to check the status of all processes.
Return the number of processes that is not in the status of unused.

For the testing of getprocs() function. I have written a "int testgetprocs(void)" function in user/ folder.
Then running "make qemu" when qemu prompt, run the command:
  $ testgetprocs();
The result of running function of getprocs() will be provided.
